# About the project WestVsRest
West Vs. Rest is a web application that presents data from the World Bank to show the disparity between the traditionally "western" countries and the rest of the world. I used data from the World Bank, to present the gdp per capita, primary school enrollment and life expectancy in each country. I used Data Maps and d3 to present the data on the world map. 

# How to run

You can access the application by downloading all the files and opening the index file.
